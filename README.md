# A3_VEMF_Reloaded
This repository is dedicated to TheVampire and contains a rebooted version of VEMF

### INSTALL/CONFIG
- click the 'download as zip' button on the right <br />
- move that zip somewhere where you want it to be and unpack it. <br />
- open the VEMF folder that is inside of it and open configuration.sqf <br />
- look in there and configure all of the stuff to your likings :) <br />
- when ready, simply repack the contents of the VEMF folder into a pbo <br />
- upload/place that pbo on your server's @epochhive\addons\ <br />
- take the code from init.sqf in this repository and copy it over into your own init.sqf. If you already have a hasInterface check in your init.sqf, simple copy only line 3-14 and put it inside of that hasInterface check you already have. <br /> 
- done! :D have fun with it. Peace!
